# Determinants-of-Economic-Growth

An analysis was carried out on various factors that influence GDP. I compared GDP growth rate in oil producing and non-oil producing countries, GDP growth rate in OECD and non-OECD countries amongst others. The analysis helped uncover valuable insights which I hope you also find interesting as you read further.

### Data Background

The raw data used in this piece was sourced from Online complements to Stock and Watson (2007) through this link: https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/AER/GrowthDJ.csv

This dataset includes the Determinants of Economic growth in 121 countries between years 1960 and 1985, which was used for the purpose of this article. The data examined qualitative features collected from these countries with responses ranging between yes or no (oil production, better quality of data, membership of OECD). It as well examined numerical data (per capita GDP in 1960 and 1985, growth rate of GDP, population growth etc). This data is of interest to determine the drivers of economic growth.
